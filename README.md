# AbandonedObjectDetection

This code detects abandoned objects from single or multiple camera video sequences using
independent component analysis and independent vector analysis

> Run function "detect_abandonedObject(folder,varargin)" to detect abandoned objects

2. Real-valued ICA by entropy rate bound minimization (ICA-ERBM)
3. Independent vector analysis using multivariate power exponential distribution prior (IVA-MPE) also known as IVA-GGD
